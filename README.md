# Gene-Sequencing-
•	Machine Learning Classification problem. Classifying Gene Sequences as Exons, Introns, or Neither.
•	Preprocessed Data be removing nucleotide sequences that contained ambiguous values
•	Label Encoded the nucleotides
•	Label encoded Exons, Introns, and Neither
•	Used KNN, Logistic Regression, QDA, and Deep Learning to classify the Data
•	Use K-fold cross validation to determine K for KNN
•	Used one vs rest on Logistic Regression 
•	Used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data
•	Made custom Neural Network to classify data
•	Used convolutional layers first since there is information in the ordering of the nucleotides
•	Used tanh as the activation function
•	All classifiers had accuracy between 82%-84%
